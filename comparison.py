"""
ARC x Guardian x ledger: render the three-layer comparison from the verified matrix results.

This is a presenter, not a measurer. Every Guardian and ledger cell it prints comes from
results/matrix_scorecard.json, which verify.py re-derives from the wire transcript, so the
comparison introduces no second source of truth and nothing it shows rests on its own say-so.

The ARC column is taken from ARC's merged, maintainer-run fixture (pinned in COMPARISON.md).
It is not measured by this suite, and it has not yet been independently reproduced.

  python3 matrix.py         # produce the verified results first
  python3 comparison.py     # render the three-layer table from them
